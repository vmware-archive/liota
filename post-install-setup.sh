# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# Details:
#	This program is intended to be run after the software is installed
#	mainly as an install helper.  The "normal" way liota would be
#	installed is via pip, or possibly git, assuming you don't get the
#	software from your distro (which is *ALWAYS* the preferred method).
#	This will run through and setup some directories and copy some
#	config files around into the right places so that you can run this
#	and just get running.
#
# Caveats:
#	There are going to be a bunch of assumptions about how your local
#	system is setup, and these might not ultimately be correct.
#	This will modify your system, should be run as root (it's going to 
#	create directories and such in places that a normal user would not
#	have access to, and you should always be cautious in running this,
#	or any software as root, at the best of times.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Things that are being done / todo list
#	- Check for the users we'll be using
#		- Check the root user
#		- Check the liota user
#		- Check the liota group
#	- Configuration files: /etc/liota
#		- If /etc/liota doesn't exist, make it
#		- Change the owner and group to what we are expecting
#		- Change the permissions on the configuration directory
#		- Check if the example config exists
#		- Copy the exapmle to the config dir
#		- Change the owner and group to what we are expecting
#		- Change the permissions on the config file
#	- Deal with setting up the logging directory
#		- mkdir
#		- change owners
#		- change perms
